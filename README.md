# thumb-gesture-classification

This is a project on image classification using the HaGRID dataset from Kaggle. For this project, I decided to make a model that can classify whether an image has a thumbs up or thumbs down. The dataset has 200 images in the 2 classes, like and dislike, with 100 images in each class. Both 100 images are split into 75 training images and 25 test images.
